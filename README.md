# CE888-Assignment-1
Project 1: Aerial Imagery Pile Burn Image detection using Deep Learning: for the ’FLAME Dataset'

# How to Use the Data

I have used data from IEEE DataPort https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/flame-dataset-aerial-imagery-pile-burn-detection-using-drones-uavs. It contains 39,375 frames that resized to 254x254 for the ‘Fire-vs-NoFire’ image classification problem (Training/Validation dataset). The size of this dataset is 1.3 GB and the format is JPEG. Also, another 8,617 frames are labeled for the test data of size 287.58 MB.

# How to use the code
